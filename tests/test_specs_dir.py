"""SPEC-0079: `_specs_dir` must not resolve against the current working directory.

The old fallback was `Path.cwd() / "docs" / "specs"`. Because pytest runs from the repo root, a
test whose config fixture omitted `specs_dir` silently resolved — and wrote — against the live
`docs/specs` while believing it was sandboxed in `tmp_path`. That actually happened during
SPEC-0078 (two tracked spec files were modified and reverted), and `promote_idea` would have
created a brand-new tracked spec file the same way.
