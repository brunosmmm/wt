# wt-generate

## When to use

You have an **internal** spec (`docs/specs/SPEC-NNNN`) that's `accepted` (or further along)
and you're ready to start doing the work — you need it broken into trackable org tasks, not
just prose.

**Outbound** (`PROJ-NNNN` in the wt data-dir outbox): do **not** generate. Use `/wt-export`,
then `/wt-implement-spec` in the target repo (SPEC-0041 / SPEC-0045). The CLI refuses
`wt spec generate` on outbound ids.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the spec is at least `accepted` — `wt spec generate` on a `draft`/`proposed` spec is
   premature; finish authxxing it first (see `wt-new-work`). Confirm the id is `SPEC-NNNN`
   (internal), not an outbound `PROJ-NNNN`.
2. Generate tasks: `wt spec generate <SPEC-ID>`. Run `wt spec generate --help` for the exact
   flag syntax (target file, JIRA key linking).
   - For an **epic**, tasks come from its Breakdown/sub-specs.
   - For a **feature**, tasks come from its Acceptance criteria.
3. If this work is tracked against an external ticket, key the generated tasks so time-tracking
   can join to them later — see `wt spec generate --help` for how to pass that key.

## Conventions / guardrails

- Re-running `wt spec generate` on the same spec should not duplicate tasks it already
  generated — verify with `wt tasks` before assuming you need to regenerate.
- Task keying matters for `wt digest` (which joins tracked time to tasks by that key) — don't
  skip it if this work will be time-tracked against a ticket.
- Never point this skill at outbound specs.

## Verify

`wt tasks` lists the new tasks (filter with `--project`/`--tag`/`--key` as needed). Once time is
logged against them, `wt digest` should join tracked hours to the same tasks — spot-check that
before considering this step done.
