# wt-rework

## When to use

An idea already has a linked `:SPEC:` and either:

- the **design was wrong** (rework / supersede), or
- the linked work is an **incomplete epic** (extend — open Breakdown, missing/incomplete children).

Do **not** use this to silently rewrite a past-`draft` spec. Do **not** use for first-time authxxing (`wt-new-work`) or blank captures (`wt-capture` / `wt-seed`).

## Procedure

0. **Gate:** `wt idea show <ID>` — must show a `:SPEC:` / linked spec id. If none, stop (use
   `wt-explore` / `wt-new-work` instead).
1. **Fork** — ask the user if unclear; do not guess:
   - **Rework** — design is wrong.
   - **Extend** — epic Breakdown / children still open.

### Rework

1. `wt idea log <ID> --note "…"` — why the current design fails (durable). For outbound
   product-fit misses prefer `wt spec fit-log <OUTBOUND-ID> --note "…"` (SPEC-0049) so the
   note is tagged and linked from the outbound id.
2. Authxx a **new** spec that `supersedes` the bad one (same namespace: internal
   `docs/specs/` or outbound outbox). Set the old spec `status: superseded` +
   `superseded_by: <new-id>`. Never silent rewrite past `draft`.
3. Rare restart: `wt spec new --force` only with logged rationale (see `--help`).
4. Bring the new spec to `accepted` (lint / ledger for internal). Then generate/export as usual.

### Extend (`kind: epic`)

1. Read the epic: open Breakdown `- [ ]` items and existing children (`parent: <epic-id>`).
2. Scaffold missing child specs with `parent: <epic-id>` (internal or outbound per routing).
3. Update epic Breakdown checkboxes as children land / are accepted.
4. When a child is `accepted`: `wt spec generate <child-id>` (idempotent; new tasks only) for
   **internal** children. Outbound: do not generate.
5. Outbound: when children are accepted, prefer REMOVED **epic** export so `parent:`
   children compose into one deliverable (SPEC-0047); per-child feature export remains valid
   for standalone slices. Include outcome AC / `outcome:` (SPEC-0048).
6. Do **not** mark the epic `done` until children are `done`/`superseded` (existing lint).

Exact flags: `wt spec --help`, `wt idea --help`, `wt idea log --help`.

## Conventions / guardrails

- **Explicit fork** — rework vs extend; do not invent a third path that rewrites history.
- **Supersede, don't mutate** past-draft decisions (`AGENTS.md`).
- Outbound verify includes export after new accepted children.
- Prefer org markup on idea Log notes (SPEC-0030).

## Verify

`wt next` / `wt ideas` for the idea no longer shows bare `wt tasks` while the epic is
incomplete. After a complete epic (no open Breakdown, children done/superseded), next may
show `wt tasks` (or export when still pending). Internal: `python3 tools/spec_lint.py` exits 0.
