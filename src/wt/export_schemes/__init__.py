      would otherwise emit.
    - `mode`: how `export.export_spec` should reconcile this against anything already on
      disk at `relpath` (all non-clobbering; see SPEC-0016's Division of labor section):
        "native-spec" — wt-native's own provenance-hash guard (SPEC-0015): a re-render of
                        identical source content is always a no-op; divergent content
                        needs --force.

                        artifact another tool depends on byte-for-byte).
        "owned"       — a file this scheme fully owns outright (e.g. a REMOVED task
                        spec seed): written if absent, left alone if byte-identical,
                        refuses to overwrite divergent content without --force.
        "splice"      — a shared file we do NOT own outright (e.g. project-plan.md): our
                        block (keyed by `splice_id`, e.g. an "X.Y" deliverable id) is
                        merged in — updated in place if present, appended if absent — and
                        everything else in the file is preserved untouched; refuses to
                        overwrite a divergent existing block without --force.
