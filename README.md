# wt

**wt** is two things sharing one CLI:

1. **Passive time tracking** — hours per topic from Claude Code / Cursor transcripts and
   Outlook meetings (no timer for that signal).
2. **Idea → ship** — capture, explore, accept governing specs, generate or export work,
   verify done.

Org `clock-in` / `clock-out` is **supplemental** wall-time on an idea while you build —
it does not replace passive tracking.

> **Retention:** Claude Code deletes old transcripts. Run `wt snapshot` regularly (and
> prefer a longer `cleanupPeriodDays`). Details:
> [`docs/product/concepts/time-and-retention.md`](docs/product/concepts/time-and-retention.md).

## Docs

Themed product site (MkDocs Material):

```bash
scripts/docs-serve.sh          # or: uv run mkdocs serve
```

Source: [`docs/product/`](docs/product/) — [Getting started](docs/product/guides/getting-started.md),
[Track time](docs/product/guides/track-time.md),
[Idea → ship](docs/product/guides/idea-to-ship.md),

## Install

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). From this checkout:

```bash
uv sync
uv run wt --help               # must list idea / report / projects (not a static-site tool)
uv tool install .              # PATH entry
uv tool install '.[tui]'       # optional desk: wt tui
uv run pytest
```

Config/data live under XDG (`~/.config/wt/`, `~/.local/share/wt/`), not in the repo.

```bash
wt                             # dashboard
wt topics --unmapped
wt report --week
wt idea "…" --project Meta-Tools
wt skills install              # agent playbooks → /wt-orient, …
```

Shell completion: `wt completion install --shell fish` (or bash/zsh).
