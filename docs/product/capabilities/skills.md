# Skills

Agent playbooks shipped with the repo. Humans can ignore them; agents should install
once and follow stage names.

## Install

```bash
wt skills install                 # → ~/.claude/skills (symlink)
wt skills list
wt skills install --dest ~/.cursor/skills   # optional other host
```

## Stage map

| Skill | When |
|-------|------|
| `/wt-orient` | Cold session bootstrap |
| `/wt-capture` / `/wt-seed` | Park a thought / distill a chat |
| `/wt-related` | Search before capture/promote |
| `/wt-explore` | Enrich idea — never promote |
| `/wt-new-work` | Explored idea → accepted spec |
| `/wt-generate` | Accepted internal SPEC → org tasks |
