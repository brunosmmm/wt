# Command reference

Live CLI is authoritative: `wt --help` and `wt <command> --help`. This page is a
**curated index** of top-level commands (synced by test to `wt --help`). It does not
duplicate every flag.

Bare `wt` (no subcommand) prints the today + this-week dashboard. Add `--split` for the
Claude-generating vs your-turn diagnostic.
